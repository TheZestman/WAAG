<section id= "er-overview"> <h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
After around 63 hours of Elden Ring, I finally became the Elden Lord. But was the journey worth it? I can confidently say that Elden Ring is one of the most exhilarating, meticulously crafted, games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Almost everything that I came into contact 
with left me with the feeling of actual discovery. This is not only FromSoftware’s most in-depth game to date, but also, it’s most ambitious by FAR! Elden Ring was the first fray into the open-world genre for the developer and after completion of the game, you would not be able to tell 
it’s their first open world title.  The world is enormous, the enemies are challenging, and the gameplay is adrenaline pumping. For those not familiar with FS games, there games are typically challenges meant for the player to overcome usually through extremely challenging enemies.
 Being able to transfer that into an open world setting with none of the open world fatigue and clutter was quite mind blowing. It seems as if gamers of today were growing accustomed to the consistent open-world formula that many companies were sticking to, so it is a breath of fresh air to get something that breaks that mold.</section>
 
<!-- Story section of article-->
<section id= "er-story"> <h2 id="story"> Story </h2>
The story starts with you creating a character who is referred to as “Tarnished”. These are a group of no renown, who are blessed by grace, and are keen to taken on the journey through The Lands Between and become the Elden Lord. This is still a FromSoftware game though,
 so for those unfamiliar expect very vague and cryptic storytelling. They have made it simpler for new players with sites of grace giving you a slight hint of the general direction to go. This is very welcome because The Lands Between are absolute humongous.
 While exploring the world you will find numerous characters to speak to and it is important to exhaust ALL of their dialogue, so you don’t miss any vital pieces of information. It is also pretty common to run into these characters later either as quest givers or mini bosses.
 Reading item descriptions is also important because they may also contain information about the world. I actually love this design choice because it makes the game much more immersive.

<section id="er-gameplay"> <h2 id="gameplay"> Gameplay </h2>
You can expect your typical souls gameplay with a few wrinkles throw in. For starters, there is now a dedicated jump button which allows for more mobility than ever in a FromSoftware game. And on top of that you also receive a trusty steed named Torrent. The horse comes equipped with a double jump that adds even more mobility and the world really makes use of this. 
There is a lot of vertically throughout The Lands Between so this jumping really tends to come in handy, especially when assisted with the numerous wind-tunnel type lifts that help you get higher or lower depending on your decided path. There are also numerous ways to approach the combat of the game. I chose the prisoner class, which essentially is a spell-blade, and by the end of the game I was wielding a ferocious sword in my right hand, while clutching a large staff in my left. But the way I played is not the only way, I have friends who were pure mages, knights, or dual sword builds. The game truly encourages freedom in all aspects.

<section id= "er-audio"> <h2 id="audio"> Audio/Music </h2>
Everything in this game sounds absolutely incredible. Yuju Takenouchi and Hideyuki Eto were deep in their musical bag when curating the Elden Ring soundtrack. The grandness of the opening theme will have your blood flowing every time you load up the game and that is just the opening track. 
Some of the boss songs you here in this game are absolutely incredible and set the tone for the boss you are fighting at the time. One of my favorites was Maliketh the black blade, whose song starts off humble, but derives into pure grace and elegance when he hits his second face. It is truly beautiful.

<section id="er-art"> <h2 id="art"> Art/Design </h2>
The art direction of this game is some of FromSoftwares best yet. There is no reason for this world to be as beautiful as it is. I sometimes just ride through the world and look at the scenery because it is honestly that good. The Erdtree in the center of the capital illuminates over the gorgeous world whether it be night or day.

<section id="er-verdict"> <h2 id="verdict"> Do We Reccomend?</h2>
HIGHLY RECCOMENED. This is absolutely a must play, and I can guarantee that no matter your level of gaming skill you will be able to find some fun in this game! Heck, I spent 63 hours on my first playthrough and I am already looking forward to going back. This is easily a game that I could see someone completing multiple playthroughs of and sinking hundreds of hours in. From the open-world design and storytelling to the freeing combat and rewarding exploration, it feels as if Elden Ring has set the standard for what games should strive to be.
 There is so much I didn’t experience and I simply can’t wait to dive back in!
